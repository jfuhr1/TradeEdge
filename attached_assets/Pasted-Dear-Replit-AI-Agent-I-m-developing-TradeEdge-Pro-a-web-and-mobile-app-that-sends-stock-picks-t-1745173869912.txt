Dear Replit AI Agent,

I’m developing TradeEdge Pro, a web and mobile app that sends stock picks to paying members, tracks portfolios, and provides educational content, built on an existing MVP with a dashboard, alerts, portfolio, and education zone. I previously submitted nine Epics, but they were not fully implemented. Please implement all nine Epics listed below, ensuring they integrate seamlessly with the MVP’s web and mobile interface, preserving praised features like the dashboard’s latest alerts design (stock name, symbol, current price, buy zone, targets, percentages). Generate or extend the code to create a clean, professional platform inspired by Schwab, TradingView, or Calendly, using live stock data (e.g., Yahoo Finance API) and secure payment systems (e.g., Stripe). Each Epic includes detailed requirements for features, user roles (free vs. premium customers, admins), and integrations. Please confirm receipt of this message and provide a status update after processing.

**Epic 1: Enhanced User Dashboard**
Enhance my TradeEdge Pro app’s user dashboard, building on the existing MVP design, which I’m very satisfied with, particularly the latest stock alerts (showing current price, buy zone, stock name, symbol, targets, percentages) and approaching targets (Target 1, 2, 3). Add a new section at the top for user-specific alerts (e.g., stocks hitting Target 1, 50%) to drive action, integrated with the alert system. Below alerts, add a portfolio summary showing positions, value, and profit/loss (P/L). Include an “Alerts Still in Buy Zone” table listing previously alerted stocks (stock name, symbol, buy zone), clickable to the alert detail page, with less detail than new alerts. Update the Approaching Targets section to show only user-owned stocks within 10% of Target 1, 2, or 3, using live stock data. Preserve the existing dashboard’s design and functionality, ensuring a clean, organized layout inspired by Robinhood, responsive for web and mobile. Integrate with the MVP’s portfolio and alert systems, adding a teaser for free users to upgrade for full alert visibility. Include an admin preview mode to check dashboard functionality.

**Epic 2: Alert Detail Page**
Add an alert detail page to my TradeEdge Pro app, accessible by clicking a stock alert from the dashboard’s latest alerts or buy zone table. The page displays stock name, symbol, current price, buy zone, support zone, three target prices (conservative, regular, aggressive), a narrative (up to 500 words), a stock chart image, and confluences (e.g., RSI oversold), with each confluence clickable to an educational article explaining the concept. Include a “buy” button for users to add the stock to their simulated portfolio via a form (price, shares). Free users see only one free monthly alert, with an obscured new alerts list and a teaser to upgrade; premium users (Standard, Executive, VIP, All-In Mentorship) see all details. Design a clean, TradingView-inspired layout, responsive for web and mobile, with a “Back to Dashboard” button. Integrate with the MVP’s alert and portfolio systems, ensuring real-time data. Allow admins to edit alert details post-submission for accuracy.

**Epic 3: Personalized Alert Customization and Notification System**
Add a personalized alert customization and notification system to my TradeEdge Pro app for premium users (Standard, Executive, VIP, All-In Mentorship), integrated with the alert and portfolio systems. Create a settings page where premium users select alerts (Target 1, 2, 3, 50%, 100%, custom %, X days) and delivery (text, email, push), with in-app alerts automatically sent to the dashboard’s top section. Include a form when users “buy” a stock in their simulated portfolio to set alert preferences. Notifications include messages like “TSLA has reached its first target price of $400 and could be a great place to take some profits,” triggered within 10% of target prices using live stock data. Free users have no access, with a teaser to upgrade. Design a Gmail-inspired, responsive interface with tooltips, ensuring minimal screen time. Allow admins to monitor alert triggers for accuracy. Integrate with the MVP’s dashboard for prominent alert display.

**Epic 4: Administrator Input Page for Stock Alerts**
Add an administrator input page to my TradeEdge Pro app, accessible only to admins (technical admins, stock experts), for creating new stock alerts. Build a secure form with fields for stock symbol, buy zone, support zone, three target prices (conservative, regular, aggressive), a narrative (up to 500 words), a stock chart image, and a dropdown/checklist of confluences (e.g., moving average crossover). When submitted, the alert populates the dashboard’s latest alerts section and creates an alert detail page. Design a Google Forms-inspired, responsive interface with validation (required fields, valid prices). Include role-based access control and an admin preview before publishing. Integrate with the MVP’s alert system, ensuring compatibility with dashboard and portfolio features. Add action logging for accountability.

**Epic 5: Interactive Educational Content with Progress Tracking**
Enhance my TradeEdge Pro app’s education zone, building on the existing section with videos and articles, accessible to all users with tiered access. Free users access beginner content (introductory lessons, weekly summaries); premium users (Standard, Executive, VIP, All-In Mentorship) access advanced content (e.g., technical analysis). Add interactive glossaries (hover for definitions) and video bookmarks. Create a progress tracker showing completed lessons, percentage complete, and badges (e.g., “Beginner Investor” for 5 completions, “100% Club” for 2/5/10 picks over 100% gains), linked to articles (later videos). Categorize content (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced) with a search bar. Design a Coursera-inspired, responsive interface with video embeds and articles. Add a teaser for free users to upgrade. Allow admin content creators to upload/categorize lessons/articles. Integrate with the MVP’s education zone and dashboard.

**Epic 6: One-on-One Coaching Booking with Calendar Integration**
Enhance my TradeEdge Pro app’s one-on-one coaching booking feature, accessible to all users, with premium users (Standard, Executive, VIP, All-In Mentorship) receiving discounts (e.g., 20% off) and free users paying full price ($100 for 30 minutes, $175 for 60 minutes). Create a booking system with a calendar view, topic dropdown (e.g., portfolio review), and Stripe payment integration. Integrate with Google Calendar for automatic session scheduling and Zoom link emails. Design a Calendly-inspired, responsive interface with secure payment and GDPR compliance. Add a teaser for free/Standard users to upgrade for discounts. Integrate with user profiles to track sessions. Provide an admin view for scheduling management. Ensure compatibility with the MVP’s dashboard and portfolio features.

**Epic 7: Portfolio Analytics Dashboard**
Add a portfolio analytics dashboard to my TradeEdge Pro app for premium users (Standard, Executive, VIP, All-In Mentorship), building on the existing portfolio tracking system. Include metrics: total alerts bought, total return ($), total return (%), current account balance, average return per alert, top return (%). Display a line graph of portfolio value, filterable by date range (30 days, 6 months, all time), with S&P 500 comparison using live data. Design a Schwab-inspired, responsive layout with exportable PDF reports. Add a teaser for free users to upgrade. Integrate with the MVP’s portfolio system, pulling buy/sell data. Provide an admin view of aggregate performance metrics. Ensure compatibility with dashboard and alert systems.

**Epic 8: Social Proof/Trust Center**
Add a Social Proof/Trust Center page to my TradeEdge Pro app, accessible to all users, listing alerts that have hit targets (Target 1, 2, 3, 50%, 100%, 200%, 300%, 400%, 500%) with stock name, symbol, percentage gain, and date, updated when targets are hit using live stock data. Include a sortable list and “Top Alerts All Time” section. Auto-generate “success card” images (stock name, gain, green arrow) for admin to post on social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok). Add a homepage preview of three recent successes with a “View All” link. Design a Yahoo Finance-inspired, responsive layout. Integrate with the MVP’s alert system. Provide an admin dashboard for success metrics and social media posts. Ensure free user access with a teaser for premium upgrades.

**Epic 9: Community Engagement with In-App Discussion Area**
Add an in-app community discussion area to my TradeEdge Pro app, replacing external platforms, accessible to all users with tiered permissions. Create a section for threaded chats (up to 500 characters) where users share trading ideas. Free users view and react (like); premium users (Standard, Executive, VIP, All-In Mentorship) post and create threads. Include a moderation system with a report button, managed by admin moderators. Add a homepage preview of two recent threads with a “Join Discussion” link. Integrate with user profiles, displaying usernames and tier badges (e.g., “VIP Member”). Design a Slack-inspired, responsive interface, compatible with the MVP’s dashboard and portfolio systems. Provide an admin dashboard for moderators to manage threads.

**Epic 10: Share Your Wins with Social Media “Win Card”**
Add a “Share Your Wins” feature to my TradeEdge Pro app for all users (free and premium) to generate social media “win cards” when selling a stock for a gain in their tracked portfolio. Create a “win card” image with stock name, percentage gain, username, and a success graphic (e.g., green arrow), formatted for Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok, with download/share buttons. Send admin notifications for cards, with an option to post on TradeEdge Pro’s social media. Integrate with the portfolio system to trigger card creation from buy/sell data. Design a Canva-inspired, branded look, responsive for web and mobile. Include tracking of shared cards for admin marketing insights. Ensure compatibility with the MVP’s dashboard and portfolio features.
